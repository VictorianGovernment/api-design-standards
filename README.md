# Victorian Government API Design Standard - DRAFT FOR REVIEW

The Victorian Department of Premier and Cabinet created the Digital, Design and Innovation Branch within the Governance, Policy and Coordination Group in late 2018.

A key function of this branch is to provide standards for information access across government, its partners and the community. These standards provide guidance on API governance and security and enhanced data consistency and discoverability.

These API standards are a starting point for collaboration across government. They provide a reference point to ensure interoperability is a priority when creating or modifying digital services across government.

A working group is being formulated as part of the Victorian Government CIO Leadership Group, a forum of CIOs across government, that will assist in the ratification and updating of these standards over time.

We're providing this repository to seek feedback from the working group and share with the general public the standards that are being created within government. These standards should be applicable for entities outside of government; their use is encouraged.

The API Standards have been written by the API Team, led by Jordan Walsh. Reviewers and contributors can see open issues and proposed decision points for feedback on the issues page.

For more information see the contact information below.

You can read the latest version of the standards [here](api-standards.md).

# Contributing to this standard 

We're committed to having public conversations about the technical standards. Questions or comments that participants might ask us via email or private message are likely to be questions or comments other participants have as well - our responses will be of interest to everyone. We anticipate that there will be experiences and lessons everybody can learn from. Having these conversations publicly helps us reduce duplication, resolve issues faster and keep everyone up to date with the conversation.

We ask that all contributors to the Victorian Government API Standards repositories comply with the [GitHub Community Forum Code of Conduct](https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-forum-code-of-conduct/).

In addition, it would be appreciated if the following rules are adhered to when commenting or contributing:

- Provide a single, considered response to each proposal covering all feedback concerning the proposal.

- For transparency, if you work at or are associated with an organisation with an interest in the standards, indicate this in your response.

- Ensure you are aware of and compliant with any social media guidelines or internal processes for response set by your organisation before providing feedback.
